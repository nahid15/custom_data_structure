# custom_data_structure
This code was for making a custom data structure in Python to access nested matrix and perform basic matrix operations
## Problem Description
Consider a matrix A of size R(nd x nd), where each non-overlapping d x d block of the matrix, D[i][j], is a diagonal matrix. So the matrix consists of n x n such blocks. An example of such a matrix is shown in problem_description.jpg file.

Now, Construct an efficient data structure to represent such matrices and devise algorithms to perform matrix operations, such as matrix multiplications and matrix inverse, on the data structure you designed.
