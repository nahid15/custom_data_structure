Algorithm 1: Algorithm to calculate matrix multiplication:

1.	Start
2.	Read two matrix A and B
3.	Initialize a resultant matrix with all zeroes
4.	Then multiply each row elements of first matrix with the corresponding column elements of second matrix and add up those multiplied values
5.	Continue this process for all each row of first matrix and update resultant matrix with these values
6.	Display the result
7.	Stop


Algorithm 2: Algorithm to find Inverse matrix:

1.	Start
2.	Read a matrix (A)
3.	Get the size of the matrix n
4.	Create an identity matrix (I) of n x n block
5.	Create an empty n x n matrix (to store final result) 
6.	Create an empty n x 2n matrix
7.	Joint matrix (A) and Identity matrix (I) into n x 2x Augmented matrix [A|I] 
8.	Transport the row operation until it looks like [I|A]
	a. first, make first portion as diagonal matrix
	b. obtain solution by making the diagonal element 1
9.	Separate the second half of the augmented matrix to the empty n x n matrix
10.	Display the result
11.	Stop
